What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A directory .git is created. This contents meta data that describes information change

How ist the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Working directory holds actuall files i work on. These are the files
	that are modified each time i open an editor and add and change code
	lines. Staging area is a place to put file  which modifications are
	going to be recorded. Staging area can be thought as an intermediate
	ans transitory place between working directory and repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	executing -git diff-, One can verify that just one logical change in
	a file has been staged. This way next commit will track just this change

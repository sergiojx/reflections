What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A directory .git is created. This contens meta data that describes information
change

How ist the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory holds actuall files i work on. These are the files
that are modified each time i open an editor and add and change code
lines. Staging area is a place to put file  which modifications are
going to be recorded. Staging area can be thought as an intermediate
ans transitory place between working directory and repository
